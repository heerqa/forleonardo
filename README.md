### About Projects ###

Java test

Main Page

Create a simple HTML page where you can create a Project
When you create a project, status default value is “activated”
In the same page, list all the active projects and the people linked to each project. 
A project might have not people in it.
Each project item should be a link. When you click on this link, you go to page “Project Edition page”



Project Edition Page

In this page you can edit name, description and project status. 
When you un-set project status, you should display an alert message “This project won’t be listed in main page, are you sure you want to deactivated this project?”
Also in this page you’ll have a region with a list of People linked to the project. You can add and remove People from the project. 
The select box should contain all the available people. When you click any item of the select box, the people is automatically added to the project. 


Notes:
Project status: A true/false value that indicates that the project is activated or not. 
People bean class should have two fields: firstName and lastName.

Conditions to pass the test:

You should use JQUERY, last available version. 
You should use AJAX. (We rarely submit forms)
You must use JDBC, not an ORM tool. 
You should use Tomcat or Jetty. 
The project must be a Java Web Project. 
You must solve the test applying MVC pattern. You can write your own small framework or use an existing technology as Spring MVC, Stripes or Struts. 
You should use transactions in your services. 
Using Bootstrap will be considered as a plus. 

Depending on the test results, you’ll be considered as Junior, Semi Senior or Senior developer.
Have fun and good luck!!!
